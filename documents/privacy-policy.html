        <h1>Privacy Policy for MeezanSync</h1>

        <p>Effective Date: 5 January 2025</p>

        <p>MeezanSync ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
            use, and safeguard your data when you use our App. By using the App, you agree to the practices described in
            this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We collect your name, email address, and phone number when you
                join or create user groups. If you use social login services (e.g., Google or Facebook), we only collect
                the necessary data for authentication and do not share app usage data with these services.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We collect your location only when you enable location services for the
                Qibla Compass feature.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> We may use Firebase to track feature usage to improve the App's
                functionality and prioritize impactful features. No personally identifiable information is shared with
                Firebase.</li>
            <li><strong>Bookmarks and Reading Progress:</strong> If you log in, we save your bookmarks and recent pages
                in the cloud to sync across your devices. If you do not log in, this data remains on your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and improve the App’s features, such as syncing bookmarks and determining the Qibla
                direction.</li>
            <li>To support user groups and encourage collective Quran reading.</li>
            <li>To analyze feature usage and enhance the App based on user preferences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Sharing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your cloud-synced data is securely stored on our Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosted on Linode or AWS
                EC2.</li>
            <li>We do not sell or share your data with third parties except as required for the functioning of the App
                (e.g., cloud storage services).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. User Consent</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We request your consent to access location data when you enable the Qibla Compass feature.</li>
            <li>Data syncing occurs only after you log in. This is clearly communicated on the login screen.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your data is retained indefinitely unless otherwise specified. This policy may change in the future with
                prior notice.</li>
            <li>You can request to delete your data. Although the feature is not yet implemented, it is part of our
                development roadmap.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Future Features</h2>
        <p>As we add new features, such as the BLE tasbeeh counter, this Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect any
            new data collection and usage practices. Users will be notified of any significant changes.</p>

        <h2>7. Protecting Your Data</h2>
        <p>We use industry-standard encryption and security measures to protect your data. However, no method of
            transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is intended for users of all ages. However, login features require an account, and social
            authentication services may have age restrictions.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Users will be notified of any significant changes
            through the App or email.</p>
