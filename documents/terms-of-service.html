        <h1>Terms of Service for MeezanSync</h1>
    
        <p>Effective Date: 5 January 2025</p>
    
        <p>Welcome to MeezanSync ("the App"). By using the App, you agree to comply with these Terms of Service. If you do
            not agree, please refrain from using the App.</p>
    
        <h2>1. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>MeezanSync is a non-profit app aimed at facilitating Quran reading and group participation. Users are
                expected to use the App responsibly and respectfully.</li>
            <li>As the App displays group scoreboards and limited user details (e.g., name, scores, and avatar), users
                should not attempt to access or misuse data beyond what is provided.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>2. Service Availability</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The App is provided on a goodwill basis and may face limitations due to resource constraints or budgetary
                challenges. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the App or its features without prior notice.</li>
            <li>The App does not offer any paid features. Donations are welcome and will be used to support the team and
                maintain infrastructure, but they do not entitle donors to additional services or guarantees.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>3. Account Management</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their accounts. Any activities under your
                account are your responsibility.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to terminate accounts for any violations of these Terms of Service or any other misuse
                of the App.</li>
            <li>The App does not display sensitive data such as email addresses or phone numbers of other users.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>4. Liability Limitations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Quran content in MeezanSync is sourced from the Tanzil Project, an authenticated database. If you find
                errors, please notify the Tanzil Project team. Updates from their database will be reflected in the App over
                time.</li>
            <li>We are not liable for any data loss resulting from server issues, resource constraints, or other
                limitations. As a non-profit app, we do not guarantee the availability or accuracy of data at all times.
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>5. Changes to These Terms</h2>
